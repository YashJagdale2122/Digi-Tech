# Digi-Tech

## Overview
`Digi-Tech` is an **early-stage static website project** built using **HTML and CSS**.  
This repository represents one of my **initial hands-on experiments** with web fundamentals and UI structure during my early learning phase.

It is intentionally kept public to reflect my learning progression, but it is **not part of my current backend-focused portfolio**.


## What This Project Is
- A simple static website built with:
  - HTML for structure
  - CSS for styling and layout
- Focused on understanding:
  - Page structure
  - Basic layouts
  - Styling fundamentals
  - Organizing static assets


## What This Project Is NOT
This project does **not** represent:
- Backend development
- API design
- System architecture
- Production-level engineering
- Async processing or scalable systems

For backend and system-oriented work, please refer to my **pinned repositories**.


## Why This Repository Exists
This repository is preserved to:
- Show my **starting point** in software development
- Demonstrate **learning progression over time**
- Maintain transparency in my engineering journey


## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS


## Future Improvements (If Revisited)
- Improve semantic HTML
- Add responsive design
- Refactor CSS structure
- Introduce basic accessibility practices



## Notes
This project is **not pinned** and should be viewed as an **early learning artifact**, not a representation of my current skill level.
